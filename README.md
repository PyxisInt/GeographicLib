# GeographicLib
This is a .NET/C# port of GeographicLib (https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/) - A library of classes to geographic, UTM, UPS, MGRS, geocentric, and local cartesian coordinates, for gravity (e.g., EGM2008), geoid height, and geomagnetic field (e.g., WMM2010) calculations, and for solving geodesic problems. The original library, written by C. F. F. Karney, is in C++ and while there is an existing .NET wrapper, this is a pure C# port of the original. This library is released under the MIT/X11 license (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Usage
Use Nuget to add this library to your project. One way to do this via the console/terminal:
```
dotnet add package PyxisInt.GeographicLib --version <latest_version_tag>
```
You can see the latest version tag above.
